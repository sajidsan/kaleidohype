# kaleidohype
creating a kaleidoscope poster with the processing hype framework + nodebox

This project is a riff off a bunch of work by the incredible Joshua Davis (http://www.joshuadavis.com/) and I've used it to create a poster with a large amount of sickness. Now you can too!

You can see my writeup of the process here on skillshare. I write funny! check it out:
